## Introduction
Welcome to the BECS Tracer project! This innovative learning tool is designed to prepare students for the exciting world of programming, with a focus on the Python programming language. Our project is built using JavaScript and the powerful Codecheck2's Tracers API, enabling us to provide a rich, interactive learning experience.

## Purpose
The purpose of the BECS Tracer project is to introduce students to the fundamentals of Python programming and help them develop their skills through a series of challenges and exercises. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in Python, enabling them to confidently tackle advanced programming tasks and build their own projects.

## Milestones
The BECS Tracer project is divided into seven milestones, each containing a set of unique problems designed to incrementally build students' understanding of Python programming concepts. Each milestone introduces new topics and concepts, while reinforcing previously learned material.

### Milestone 1
Milestone 1 does not currently have any content added yet. It will be updated soon!

### Milestone 2
In Milestone 2, students will explore math operators and their applications in Python programming. They will learn how to perform arithmetic and other essential mathematical operations to solve various challenges.

### Milestone 3
Milestone 3 is dedicated to printing strings, teaching students how to manipulate and format text in Python. This milestone covers string concatenation, string formatting, and working with escape characters.

### Milestone 4
Milestone 4 revolves around calculating weekly wages. Students will apply their understanding of variables, math operators, and string formatting to build programs that calculate and display employee wages based on hours worked and pay rates.

### Milestone 5
In Milestone 5, students will learn how to use the `input()` function to obtain user input and create interactive programs. They will explore different ways to process and validate user input, allowing them to develop more dynamic applications.

### Milestone 6
Milestone 6 introduces students to if-statements and conditional logic. They will learn how to write programs that make decisions based on user input or other conditions, enabling them to create more sophisticated applications.

### Milestone 7
The final milestone, Milestone 7, focuses on while loops and their applications in Python programming. Students will learn how to create and control loops to execute code repeatedly, enhancing their ability to solve complex problems and automate repetitive tasks.

## Technology Stack
The BECS Tracer project is built using the following technologies:

- JavaScript: The primary programming language used to create the interactive learning platform.
- Codecheck2's Tracers API: A powerful API that enables us to provide a rich, interactive learning experience for students as they progress through the course.

We hope you enjoy your journey with BECS Tracer and find it to be a valuable resource in your Python programming education! Happy coding!
